But
as
the
same
constitution
which
gives
the
commons
a
power
to
check
the
king
by
withholding
the
supplies
gives
afterwards
the
king
a
power
to
check
the
commons
by
empowering
him
to
reject
their
other
bills
it
again
supposes
that
the
king
is
wiser
than
those
whom
it
has
already
supposed
to
be
wiser
than
him
A
mere
absurdity
There
is
something
exceedingly
ridiculous
in
the
composition
of
monarchy
it
first
excludes
a
man
from
the
means
of
information
yet
empowers
him
to
act
in
cases
where
the
highest
judgment
is
required
The
state
of
a
king
shuts
him
from
the
world
yet
the
business
of
a
king
requires
him
to
know
it
thoroughly
wherefore
the
different
parts
by
unnaturally
opposing
and
destroying
each
other
prove
the
whole
character
to
be
absurd
and
useless
Some
writers
have
explained
the
English
constitution
thus
the
king
say
they
is
one
the
people
another
the
peers
are
an
house
in
behalf
of
the
king
the
commons
in
behalf
of
the
people
but
this
hath
all
the
distinctions
of
a
house
divided
against
itself
and
though
the
expressions
be
pleasantly
arranged
yet
when
examined
they
appear
idle
and
ambiguous
and
it
will
always
happen
that
the
nicest
construction
that
words
are
capable
of
when
applied
to
the
description
of
some
thing
which
either
cannot
exist
or
is
too
incomprehensible
to
be
within
the
compass
of
description
will
be
words
of
sound
only
and
though
they
may
amuse
the
ear
they
cannot
inform
the
mind
for
this
explanation
includes
a
previous
question
viz
How
came
the
king
by
a
power
which
the
people
are
afraid
to
trust
and
always
obliged
to
check
Such
a
power
could
not
be
the
gift
of
a
wise
people
neither
can
any
power
which
needs
checking
be
from
God
yet
the
provision
which
the
constitution
makes
supposes
such
a
power
to
exist
